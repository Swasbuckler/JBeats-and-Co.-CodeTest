This is a fun project I chose to do for my friends to further develop an inside joke of the JBeats and Co. company.

It is fully Frontend because I wanted it to be hosted on GitHub Pages, and it is made using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript without Frameworks.

I have learnt many things throughout the process of doing this project, especially on Frontend Development. Some section that was inspired from creators can be seen below:
- A Physics Engine based on Two-Bit Coder's "Let's Make a Physics Engine" YouTube Series
- A Endless Scroller based on Hyperplexed's YouTube video, "Award Winning Animation With Only 20 Lines Of CSS?"
- Orbiting Circles based on Kevin Powell's YouTube video, "Can I create this tricky orbiting icon animation?"

The website is very simple that makes use of CSS animations for smooth movements of elements with JavaScript used when viewing the team members of JBeats and Co.

An alternative version of the website can be accessed to see other design choices that were considered.

The physics engine can be played or skipped depending on your mood while going through the website.

At the end of day, it was a fun project where I had learnt a lot. I hope you do enjoy the website!
